##  Netflix-Clone Challenge for  Abstract Solutions 

Basic Netflix Clone, using IMDB Api https://imdb-api.com/api/. I opted for Next Js, and Tailwind for styling, fully responsive which means I went Mobile First.

For icons I integrated React-icons library, and for the loader components, react-loader-spinner.

As for the Api calls, I used Axios, which makes requests to TV or Movie Titles.

I tried to keep it simple, to not over do it since those were the instructions, and to recreate as much as I could from the given picture.

On a last note, the pictures after the calls are rendered a bit poorly, but I don't know if that's because I didn't use getStaticProps from Next, or what in my code could be causing that, since I tried to fix it with no luck.
